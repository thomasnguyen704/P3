## Description P3: Laravel Basics

<p>The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the essentials of building a Laravel-based site. In building this project you'll demonstrate an understanding of the following skills:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Creating a new Laravel app.</li>
	<li>Installing and using Composer packages.</li>
	<li>Routing basics.</li>
	<li>Views.</li>
	<li>Deploying a Laravel app on a live server.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Create a web application called <em>Developer's Best Friend</em> which includes a <strong>Lorem Ipsum Generator</strong> and a <strong>Random User Generator</strong>.</p>

<p>Your landing page should include a description of your app with either links to the two tools, or with the two tools present on the page.</p>

<p>The tools should be powered by HTML forms where the user can specify how many paragraphs they want, how many users they want, etc.</p>

<p>For your lorem ipsum text, you can use a Package such as <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/badcow/lorem-ipsum">badcow/lorem-ipsum</a>.</p>

<p>For your random users, you can use a Package such as <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/fzaninotto/faker">fzaninotto/faker</a>.</p>

<p>These packages are just suggestions; you're welcome to use others or write your own functionality.</p>
